### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

I am Joey - a software engineer at Trevipay who moonlights as a Javascript Instructor for the [Launchcode](https://www.launchcode.org/) LC101 program. I am super passionate about showing that it doesn't take a degree to change your life and land a job in Tech! I enjoy learning new things, teaching those things to people we are interested, and implementing them in my day to day life. One of my aspirations is to speak at a conference on the pros and cons of hiring non typical developers!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my experience with the Global Game Jam
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Twitter [@JoeCowsert](https://twitter.com/JoeCowsert) or cowsertjoe@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I used to be a Costume Character performer at Six Flags
